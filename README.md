The JavaScript: Password Generator is an application that generates a random and secure password based on criteria specified by the user. The application presents a series of prompts to the user, asking for password length and character types such as uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters. After validating the user input, the application generates a password that matches the selected criteria and displays it on the page.
